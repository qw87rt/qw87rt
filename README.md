- 👀 I'm interested in all sorts of stuff the world has to offer, including technology, science, history, art, literature, and more. I love learning about new things and exploring different perspectives on the world.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning programming, analytics, and software development. I'm excited about the endless possibilities that technology offers and the ways it can be used to make a positive impact on the world. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas.
